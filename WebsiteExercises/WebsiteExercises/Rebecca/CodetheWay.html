    <h3><u>Mission</u></h3>
    <p>
        Code the Way facilitates the collaboration of schools, companies, and nonprofits to:
        (1) Offer students advanced computer science training and real-world job experiences working on projects that benefit nonprofits;
        (2) Increase certified computer science teachers; and
        (3) Contribute to the technology talent base.
    </p>
    <p>Code the Way model includes: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Student access to real-world job experience – In addition to an advanced course that may earn
            post-secondary credits, students get experience working collaboratively on a project that benefits
            a nonprofit, culminating in a presentation to business leaders.
        </li>
        <li>
            Companies are part of the solution – Companies invest in education, make technology
            more accessible to nonprofits, offer their employees a meaningful
            volunteer experience, and contribute to the talent pipeline.
        </li>
        <li>
            Increasing certified computer science teachers – Support and training
            for computer science teacher certification increase the
            availability and quality of high school computer science programs.
